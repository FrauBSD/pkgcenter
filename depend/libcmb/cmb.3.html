If
.Ar debug
is non-zero and
.Xr cmb 3
was compiled with
.Ql CMB_DEBUG ,
enable debugging information on stderr.
.Pp
If
.Ar nul_terminate
is non-zero,
.Fn cmb_print
will print combination items separated by ASCII NUL character
.Pq character code 0 .
is enumerated by
.Fn cmb
/
.Fn cmb_bn
and counted by
.Fn cmb_count
/
.Fn cmb_count_bn .
.Pp
If
.Ar show_numbers
is non-zero,
print combination sequence number before calling
.Fn action .
Combinations are calculated in arithmetic progression,
providing predictable order.
The sequence number can be used as
.Ar start
or
.Ar start_bn
value to begin at that combination.
The sequence number precedes the prefix and is followed by a single space,
regardless of
.Ar delimiter .
.Pp
For each combination,
if
.Ar prefix
is non-NULL it is printed before the first item in each combination and
.Ar suffix ,
if non-NULL,
is printed after the last item.
.Pp
To operate on only a subset or range of subsets,
use
.Ar size_min
and
.Ar size_max .
Only combinations containing at minimum
.Ar size_min
items and at most
.Ar size_max
items will be calculated.
.Pp
To limit the number of combinations that are calculated,
set
.Ar count
to a non-zero value.
.Pp
If
.Ar start
is greater than one,
to overcome limitations by 64-bit integers.
.Pp
.Fn cmb_version
takes
.Li CMB_VERSION
or
.Li CMB_VERSION_LONG
as
.Ar type
and returns string version.
For unknown
.Ar type ,
the text
.Dq not available
is returned.
