.Nm cmb
.Nd combinatorics library
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libcmb
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In cmb.h
.Ft int
.Fn cmb "struct cmb_config *config" "uint32_t nitems" "char *items[]"
.Ft int
.Fn cmb_print "uint32_t nitems" "char *items[]"
.Ft uint64_t
.Fn cmb_count "struct cmb_config *config" "uint32_t nitems"

/* OpenSSL
.Xr bn 3
support */

.Ft int
.Fn cmb_bn "struct cmb_config *config" "uint32_t nitems" "char *items[]"
.Ft "BIGNUM *"
.Fn cmb_count_bn "struct cmb_config *config" "uint32_t nitems"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library provides a light-weight,
portable,
and fast interface for enumerating combinations.
.Pp
Anatomy of config argument to
.Fn cmb* :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct cmb_config {
    uint8_t nul_terminate; /* Terminate combinations with NUL */
    char    *delimiter;    /* Item separator (default is " ") */
    char    *prefix;       /* Prefix for each combination */
    char    *suffix;       /* Suffix for each combination */
    uint32_t range_min;    /* Minimum elements in combination */
    uint32_t range_max;    /* Maximum elements in combination */

    uint64_t count;        /* Number of combinations */
    uint64_t start;        /* Starting combination */

    /* OpenSSL bn(3) support */
    BIGNUM  *count_bn;     /* Number of combinations */
    BIGNUM  *start_bn;     /* Starting combination */

    /*
     * Function pointer; action to perform for each combination
     * (default is cmb_print()). If the return from action() is non-
     * zero, cmb() will stop calculation. The cmb() return value is
     * the first non-zero result from action(), zero otherwise.
     */
    int (*action)(uint32_t nitems, char *items[]);
};

.Pp
If
.Ar nul_terminate
is non-zero,
.Fn cmb_print
will print combination items separated by ASCII NUL character
.Pq character code 0 .
Otherwise,
if
.Ar nul_terminate
is zero
.Pq default ,
.Ar delimiter
is used and if unset,
combinations are separated by a single space.
.Pp
For each combination,
if
.Ar prefix
is non-NULL it is printed before the first item and
if
.Ar suffix
is non-NULL it is printed after the last item.
.Pp
To operate on only a subset or range of subsets,
use
.Ar range_min
and
.Ar range_max .
Only combinations containing at minimum
.Ar range_min
items and at most
.Ar range_max
items will be calculated.
.Pp
To limit the number of combinations that are calculated,
set
.Ar count
to a non-zero value.
.Pp
If
.Ar start
is greater than one,
the
.Nm
library will seek to that number combination before starting.
.Pp
.Ar count_bn
and
.Ar start_bn
are only available on platforms with OpenSSL
.Xr bn 3
and are used by
.Fn cmb_bn
and
.Fn cmb_count_bn
to overcome limitations by 64-bit integers.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
library first appeared in
.Fx 13.0 .
